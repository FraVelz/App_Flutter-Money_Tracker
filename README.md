# Money Tracker

Project #1 with Flutter. Money manager(tracker).

It is a project developed from the course (Adrián Sáenz)

to learn how to create applications in dart with flutter, it does not have the best way of teaching or the most efficient but it was one of the first courses to create apps that I did with flutter in addition to making and customizing the interface in my own way by looking for information in other sources to be able to do it.

* Custom interface color.
* Current project without errors found.
* Clean code.
* Public repository and code :)

> Best regards!!!
